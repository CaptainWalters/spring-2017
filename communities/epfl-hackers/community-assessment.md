### Definition
- How would you define your community? Try to be open minded, but here are some examples of ways you could define your community: 
  - Students interested in working on cool tech projects outside of academia at EPFL.
  
### Size
- How many people are currently in your community?
  - Hard to tell as there is no official club or society, but I would estimate we are around 5 people.
- How many would you _like_ to be in your community?
	- Hard to say, but I would estimate that there are around 150 students (based on the number of EPFL students who applied to participate in LauzHack 2016) who would be interested in being part of such a community. That would be pretty great!
- Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change?
	- Can't really tell as there has been no metric. Many students are working on cool tech projects, but there hasn't really been any gathering to form a group.

### Resources
- What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech? Are there meetups, seminars, online tools, office hours, hackathons?
	- Outside of lectures, not alot.
	- I organzied the first hackathon at EPFL last year - LauzHack
	- There are colloquiums organized by the CS department at EPFL where guest lecturers present their research followed by a Q&A, although these are not very frequent and have fairly low attendance.
	- Around "recruiting season" several companies come to EPFL and have some talks and workshops.

### Accessibility
- How accessible are the current resources in your community?
	- Quite accessible - pretty much anyone can join in.
- Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?
	- There are no meetings held at the moment, although its something we're looking to start. If we do, it will be in the evenings when people aren't working/in class.

### Interests
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?
	- It contains students who study Computer Science or Communication Systems, but we're totally open to students from all areas in EPFL.
- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?
	- It is quite open to suggestion and will accomodate any topic as long as it is tech related, and there is interest in it.

### Goals
- Why do people get involved in your community?
	- Its an opportunity to work on cool project where they have the freedom to work on anything they are intersted in, rather than something they are forced to in their classwork. Its also a support structure as there are other people to guide you if you are stuck or to give you advice - this way you aren't doing this on your own.
- Are they students hoping to get a degree?
	- Yes
- Are they trying to ramp-up to get a job?
	- Yes, but not all of them
- Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major?
	- Yes
- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals?
	- Goals
		- Learn something new
		- Work on a 'side-project' on your own/with friends
	- Activities
		- Participate in hackathons
		- Have occasional meetups to discuss anything (questions, challenges, doubts about a project, a class, an interview)
		- Have regular workshops to (usually) learn/practice and (occasionally) teach something.

### Location
- Where does your community currently gather? Is it an online-only group so far, or is there a place where people can meet?
	- So far we just talk online - we aren't big enough to have "gatherings". But if/when we meet there are lots of public spaces and easily accessible classrooms at EPFL's campus.
- Is there parking, and if so, is it free?
	- Yes
- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups?
	- Yes
- Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus?
	- Yes
- How much does it cost to use the space?
	- Free
- How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings?
	- Can accomodate everything
- How many people can it fit?
	- On a regular basis upto 50 people - in more exceptional cases upto 100.
- Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes?
	- Yes
- Is there water or snacks available nearby?
	- Yes

### Communication
- How does your community get in touch with one another?
	- So far just a facebook chat group. But when the group grows, we'll definitely need a better way.
	- There is a facebook group for the computer science department at EPFL, but it is quite neglected as it is only used to anounce when exam results are out, or to occasionally advertise some event.
- Is there an email group, a GitHub organization, a Twitter account, a Facebook group, a chat room or channel?
	- Nope.
- Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating?
	- Yes, certainly! Slack would be ideal as it can host general chatter (like the facebook group HH:EU), and also more precise channels e.g. "Going to MLH prime", "Node.js enthusiasts", etc.

### Culture
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?
	- We are pretty welcoming to new people and new ideas.
- What happens if there is a disagreement?
	- As we are a rather small community, we just discuss it amongst ourselves and come to some sort of resolution. Once more formal we will have some form of community admistration which will handle this.
- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?
	- At the moment no, but as we grow we'd have something similar to the MLH code of conduct.
- How will you personally handle it?
	- If I have to handle some sort of disagreement I'd listen to both sides to understand the motives involved, and from there figure out the best way forward. If need be, also get some advice from other community mods/admin
