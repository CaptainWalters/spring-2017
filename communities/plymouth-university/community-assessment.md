# Plymouth University

Plymouth University has been having troubles with the tech community for a number of years. We've seen a seady decline in the number of tech based societies and events since around 2012. We are now in a situation where the last community left is the Game Dev Society (GDSoc). Thankfully there are still a few pockets of students who are enthusiastic about various strands of tech.

I'll be using this assessment to investigate the culture and community of Plymouth University as a whole rather than focusing on the GDSoc alone.

## Definition

Students at the University of Plymouth, UK (known as Plymouth University) who have an interest in technology and computer science. These students may be on computing / computer science courses or just have an interest they're looking to explore.

## Size

### How many people are currently in the community?

The size of the current involved community is sitting around **50**. This is just the engaged community who have together to take part and create events for themselves, primarily this is GDSoc along with a number of enthusiastic students.

### How many would you _like_ to be in the community?

In the distant future it would be wonderful to see a of the majority of the School of Computing engaging in the community, this would be around 200.

In a smaller time frame it would be good to get all 50 together for regular meets such as workshops and talks.

### Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change?

The University had a lot more tech activity when I was a fresher in 2012. It seems that students are less willing to turn up to events now, the quality seems to have remained the same and even improved yet turn out is much lower now. There is a lot less "buzz" around tech news, new tools, and opportunities.

## Resources

In particular when considering GDSoc, the amount of hardware resources avalible to us are absolutely huge. The rest of the School of Computing also have quite a few resource avalible to us but they are not so "toy-driven". Sadly the amount of experienced industry tech folk is much lower.

### What is current available to people in your community to learn about tech?

We probably have one of the biggest VR and "random-peripheral" stores for a University School of Computing in terms of hardware and software. This includes:

* Several HTC Vives
* Oculus Rifts
* Leap Motions
* Google Cardboards and a few other random VR kits
* Force feedback vests
* A high spec OSX lab
* A high spec Windows Lab (GTX 1080s etc)

In terms of locations, and other resources we have access to:

* Lecture theatres and room bookins (under a society or via a staff member)
* Projectors and screens for talks
* Flat screen TV's for smaller presentations
* GoPro's for filming events

We have a lot on offer for people to take and hack around with equipment. They can be booked out and used for projects, events, and demos as students wish. The place we're lacking is with events and knowledge spreading. A common issue seems to be that someone learns something but doesn't feel the need to share it, they either assume it's obvious, unimportant, or never consider sharing it.

### Are there meetups, seminars, online tools, office hours, hackathons?

GDSoc host weekly meetups which have had seadily declining turnout, this seems mostly due to workload right now according to members. GDSoc also runs a large 24h Game Jam each semester, this enables people to get really stuck in with silly game projects and a lot has come out of this. A local group (Plymouth Game Devs) run by some Plymouth alumni also runs regular shorter Game Jams. There don't seem to be any more general hackathons or events running in the area, not for at least 3 years anyway.

Most of the local meetups are tailored to Game Dev which is fantastic but also excludes a lot of people with no experience or desire to build games. This means a lot of events tend to feel isolated from a lot of the university. Due the small nature of the software industry in Plymouth there are no general meetups or seminars past that which the uni or societies decide to run.

## Accessibility

### How accessible are the current resources in your community?

* Hardware is readily available to any student at the University though much of the VR kit is often only taken by Game Dev students.
* All campus locations have wheelchair access to every room.
* GDSoc events are often limited to members. Larger events like guest speakers are often open to all at the University with priority to GDSoc members, Game Jams are the same.

### Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?

Most events take place in the evenings, the only exceptions are guest speakers where the organisers always try to suit the speakers time preferences. Game Jams are generally held at weekends to allow sleep catch up.

### Is there childcare available?

No, this isn't currently within the means of GDSoc and the rest of the campus community is fairly disperesed.

## Interests

As the university currently only has one tech based society, most of this section will be dictate by that society with a view to attact new members from across the university.

### Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?

GDSoc is made up of computer scientists and aritsts, there is a large imbalance between engineers (more) and designers (fewer) within the society. However as it is often run by members of the Computing & Games Dev course it's content is often more tailored towards engineers.

I'd love to get more designers involved and also some first time programmers who aren't on comp sci courses!

### Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?

If we take the only tech society on campus then the interest is specifically games development, but the university as a whole has many computing and comp sci course flavours who have a wide range of interests from web to AI and all sorts.

## Goals

### Why do people get involved in the community?

One of the biggest across the university seems to be obtaining a 1 year internship for their "sandwich year", or for getting a job after their degree. Due to the games students being most involved, they also seem to get move involved when the content is likely to contribute towards current assignments.

The one of the problem with GDSoc is that most of the Games Dev course content is based on Unity3D, however this is quite an uncommon technology to use outside of mobile or indie games. Web content seems to cause heavy disengagement from GDSoc members as there seems to be a level of elitisim that attempts to stray away from web based games.

### What activities and goals can we set for the community based on existing goals?

One of the goals we could look towards is trying to find to put on technical talks by experts which relate heavily to lecture content. This has been hard due to the lack of industry in and around Plymouth but it should be a goal to strive towards.

## Location

Due to the nature of the community, the key location for all events and meets is the Plymouth University campus. Any room on campus can be booked out by a students union registered society, this means the GDSoc can book rooms with 2 weeks notice.

The bookable space is very flexible ranging from high spec computer labs which can accomodate up to around 30 or 40 people, over to large lecture theatres which can seat around 200-300. These spaces can be booked for anytime they're not already booked between the hours of 9am and 6pm. After that we need to find a different space.

Lecture theatres are generally very good for speaker based events as the chairs are often quite comfortable and suitable for longer periods of time. They also fit fire restrictions for large groups of people. The computer labs are perfect for small workshops where people can log on and make use of the computers. The chairs in these rooms are also quite comfortable but not always great for talk focused sessions.

There are many pubs with bigger spaces which can be booked for events and these tend to fit up to around 40 people. At the same time smaller meets can happen in the many cafes or pubs around the city and campus.

## Communication

* Facebook is the best medium along with websites such as EventBrite for organising wider events like Game Jams where we invite external bodies to join.
* We've tried services like Slack and Discord before which have worked somewhat in the past with realtive daily activity but over the past 2 years it's proved very ineffective.
* Mailchimp has been great for announcing longer term schedules straight to inboxes, we've found open rates are very high but engagement is no different to facebook groups.

## Culture

The culture of person-to-person interaction is good, on the whole we've never had issues with disagreements that have ever needed to be settled outside of the disagreeing parties.

In terms of the GDSoc, there are codes of conducts that oversee the running of any registered society within the university. These are generally quite strict with procedures, training is also provided to committee members to help them to navigate this process.

If I host any events which are outside of the GDSoc, which is quite likely, then an event code of conduct will be created to encourage diversity and ensure attendees feel safe. Potentially feeding a lot from the ideas proposed by Jon Skeet.
