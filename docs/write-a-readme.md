# Write a README
_This exercise will be updated with more resources after the Technical Writing talk_

The README is the first thing people see when visiting your project. In this exercise, you'll apply what you learnt during the [Technical Writing](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8mk2lfcrvmj02cb/week4.mp4?dl=0) talk to a project README.

## Task
You should complete **one** of the following:

- Open an [issue](https://github.com/campus-experts/spring-2017/issues) and describe how you would improve upon an existing project's README. It can be any project!
- Create a new README. This can be for one of your own projects, a fictional project, or a project you know of that doesn't yet have a README. When you've create the README, open an [issue](https://github.com/campus-experts/spring-2017/issues) and link to it. 

Once you've reviewed or completed a README, you'll receive feedback on your issue. **Remember** to take the time to read and comment on eachothers issues!

## Bonus activity
If you've improved upon another README, or create a README for a project without one, you could open a pull request to contribute that README to the project! Just make sure to read their contributing guidelines (usually found in CONTRIBUTING.md) and follow any pull request templates.
