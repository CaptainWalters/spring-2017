# Write a talk abstract!

This week, we'll be hearing from Lara Hogan on "Demystifying Public Speaking". In this activity, we'll apply what we've learned, and write a talk abstract. 

When conferences or meetups look for talks, typically they put out what's called a "call for papers", or "call for proposals". This is where you pitch your talk idea to the conference organisers. Part of the CFP is usually the abstract; this is a short, snappy section that gets the audience excited about your talk. The abstract is what would appear in the brochure or on the website, describing your talk to attendees who may view it. An abstract should be a paragraph or two. 

## The Task

- Come up with a talk topic. This can be something based on your current expertise, or [something you want to learn and speak about in the future](http://weareallaweso.me/for_speakers/starting-with-nothing.html).
- Write an abstract. You can find tips [here](http://weareallaweso.me/for_speakers/how-to-write-a-compelling-proposal.html) and [here](http://speaking.io/plan/writing-a-cfp/).
- Create your abstract in your fork, in your communities subfolder (the [same place](https://github.com/campus-experts/spring-2017/blob/master/todos/week-1.md) you made the community assessment and impact proposal).
- Open a pull request to submit your abstract.
- Review and comment on other abstracts!

## Stretch goals

You've written an abstract, why not submit it? 
- Check out [Papercall](http://papercall.io), [Technically Speaking](https://tinyletter.com/techspeak) or [Eventil](eventil.com) to find places to submit your talk.
- You could also look for [local meetups](meetup.com) that may be interested.
- Why not give the talk to other Campus Experts? :sparkles: Chat with Joe!
